<h1>Abstract</h1>
ArtEmotions aims to predict emotional responses to artworks by analyzing features such as art period, artist, creation year, medium, and subject focus. Building upon the WikiArt Emotions dataset, which comprises 4,105 artworks annotated for emotions evoked in observers, this project refines the data and develops a predictive model to classify viewer reactions as positive, negative, or mixed.
<h1>Introduction</h1> 

Art has long been a powerful medium for evoking emotions, with different styles, subjects, and techniques influencing viewers’ reactions in unique ways. Understanding and predicting these emotional responses is a growing area of interest in both psychology and computational analysis. *ArtEmotions* aims to bridge this gap by developing a predictive model that classifies viewer reactions to artworks as positive, negative, or mixed.  

This project builds upon the *WikiArt Emotions* dataset, a collection of 4,105 artworks annotated with the emotions they evoke in observers (Mohammad & Kiritchenko, 2018). By refining and expanding the dataset, *ArtEmotions* explores how various artistic features—such as art period, artist, creation year, medium, and subject focus—contribute to emotional perception.  

To achieve this, the *ArtEmotions Predictive Model*, developed in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook (*ArtEmotions_PredictiveModel.ipynb*), applies machine learning techniques to classify emotional responses to artworks. The model demonstrates an accuracy of approcimately 66-68, with stronger performance in detecting positve, and mixed emotions, but lower recall for negative emotions. The classification report suggests that while the model effectively captures positive reactions, improvements are needed in recognizing negative emotional responses. 

This research has broad implications, from improving art recommendation systems to advancing computational aesthetics and emotion recognition in creative works. By quantifying emotional responses to art, *ArtEmotions* offers a novel approach to analyzing the subjective experience of visual artworks through data-driven methodologies. Future work will focus on enhancing feature selection, data balacning, and algorithm optimization to improve the model's ability to capture the full spectrum of emotional reactions to art.  

<h1>Methods</h1> 

*Data Collection and Cleaning*

The original WikiArt Emotions dataset includes annotations for emotions evoked by artworks, with each piece evaluated by at least ten annotators. Annotations encompass emotions triggered by the image alone, the title alone, and the combination of both, along with ratings on a scale from -3 (dislike) to 3 (like), and indicators of whether the artwork depicts a face or body. For this project, the dataset was refined by:

- Combining separate artist and title columns into a single “artist_title” column for unique identification.
- Consolidating emotion annotations into three categories: positive, negative, and mixed/other.
- Removing columns containing "ImageOnly" and "TitleOnly" data to focus on holistic emotional responses
- Extracting face and body presence into separate binary columns (“Face”, “Body”, “None”)

*Feature Selection*

The predictive model utilizes the following features:
- Art Period: Categorization of the artwork’s historical context.
- Artist: The creator of the artwork.
- Year: The year the artwork was created.
- Medium: Distinguishing between paintings and other art forms.
- Subject Focus: Indicating whether the artwork focuses on a face, body, or neither.

*Model Development*

A Random Forest classifier was developed to predict the emotional response category (positive, negative, mixed) based on the selected features. The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, and the model was trained to predict emotional responses (positive, negative, mixed). Performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

<h1>Results</h1> 
The Random Forest classifier achieved a 65.53% on the test set. The confusion matrix showed that the model performed best in identifying positive emotions, with the most misclassification occurring between negative and mixed emotions.

<h1>Conclusion</h1> 
ArtEmotions predicts the emotional response to artworks using a machine learning approach. The model’s accuracy suggests that artistic features such as period, medium, and subject matter significantly impact emotional perception. However, certain limitations exist, such as potential biases in the dataset and the subjective nature of emotional annotations.

<h1>Future Work</h1> 
Future enhancements to ArtEmotions could include:
• Expanding Features: Incorporating additional features such as color schemes, brushstroke patterns, and thematic content.
• Larger Dataset: Augmenting the dataset with more artworks to improve model generalization.
• Real-Time Analysis: Developing applications that provide real-time predictions of emotional responses to new artworks.
